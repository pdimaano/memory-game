Create a memory card game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

To play, click and match two cards with the same color. If the cards match, they will both remain face up. If the cards do not match, they will flip back over after one second. The game ends when all the cards have been paired with their same color. The best score is recorded using the fewest number of clicks to finish the game.
